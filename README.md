## Project Description:
This project aims to gather historical weather data from OpenWeather API for all 50 US states and analyze the data to draw insights on global warming. The collected data will be used to identify trends and patterns in temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological parameters. The goal is to understand the impact of global warming on the US weather patterns and make informed predictions about future weather patterns.

## Questions to ask:
1. Does historical weather data confirm or disaffirm global warming?
2. How do weather patterns across the US help us answer this question?

## Potential Data Sources:
1. https://openweathermap.org/

### Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Research potential data sources
2. Scrape and build databases
3. Clean and organize data
4. Build charts
5. Build dashboard
