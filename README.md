## Project Description:
This project will utilize the OpenWeather API to gather extensive historical weather data for all 50 states in the US. The collected data will be analyzed to understand the impact of global warming on US weather patterns. The analysis will include trends in temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other key meteorological parameters. The results of this analysis will be used to make informed predictions about future weather patterns and to understand the role of global warming in shaping US weather patterns. The project will provide valuable insights for policymakers, climate scientists, and the general public on the effects of global warming on US weather.

## Questions to ask:
1. Does historical weather data confirm or disaffirm global warming?
2. How do weather patterns across the US help us answer this question?

## Potential Data Sources:
1. https://openweathermap.org/

### Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Research potential data sources
2. Scrape and build databases
3. Clean and organize data
4. Build charts
5. Build dashboard
